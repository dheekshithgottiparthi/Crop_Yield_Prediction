# Crop_Yield_Prediction
Developed a farmer-friendly crop yield prediction web app using Machine Learning. Based on inputs like crop type, region, season, and soil type, the system predicts expected yield (kg/ha) and provides tailored recommendations on NPK ratio, pH level, temperature, rainfall, soil preparation, and ideal planting time.
